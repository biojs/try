This is a terminal connected to a virtual Ubuntu Linux server.

It was created just for you (using Docker) when you loaded the page.

The address to your server is:

  {{host}}

You can browse the output of the biojs sniper here

  {{host}}/sniper

When you close this tab this server will shut down.

You can read this again by opening `welcome.txt` at any time.
